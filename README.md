 This is a repository for our DIS-project
-(TO RUN IT)


 On our website you can finde recipes depending on which ingrediens is in it and what appliances are needed.
 You can use the search function to find recipes related to the name of the recipe, where we have used RegEx to make partial matching. This makes us able to find eg. "bananbroed" even if we write it in two words as "banan broed".
 We have tick boxes for ingrediens, categories of recipes and appliances. The appliance tick box removes recipes that have the checked appliance, where the two other removes all recipes that don't include the checked objects. You can combine the different checkboxes, but all checked objects will be reset, if you then try to use the search function.
 We also have two extra pages "about" and "Database information".
